This phrase uses enough in the sense of “an adequate amount,” which is intended ironically to mean “a more than sufficient amount.”

- I've had enough of your excuses.
- Enough of this! I don't want to discuss it any more.

### on a/the street(s) & in a/the street(s)

in the street = on the street = on the streets

“在街上” 的意思。

如果具体到街道门牌号吗，就用 at

一些固定搭配必须用 on：

- live on the street
  有特例：She had lived in the same street in London all her life. (Longman Corpus)
- word/opinion on the street
- 在街上进行非法行为，必须用 on

例句：

- Diane's house is in (US on) Cherry Street.
- He lived at 66 Bingfield Street.

### Look out for something/somebody

### look in someone's eyes / look somebody in the eye
