# Whore & Bitch

- Bitch = A woman who is acting extremely rude or annoying

- Whore = a woman who sleeps with a lot of people - usually guys (similar to slut)

Additionally, 'bitch' can be used for either gender, and depending on the context, can even be used positively. Ex: "badass bitch".

Comparatively, 'whore' is used for females only.

The male version is 'manwhore', and is always seen as quite a low and vulgar insult.
