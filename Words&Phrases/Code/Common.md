My name is Phan An – “An” being the given name. I’m the mix of a published author, an open source proponent, a founder of several inspiring cultural/community projects, an avid reader, and a tireless wanderer.

You can find me on GitHub, Twitter, and Facebook. An outdated LinkedIn profile is also available. If you happen to read Vietnamese, I own a blog where I once in a while jot down thoughts, essays, and short stories.

Web & JavaScript enthusiast, @vuejs core team.
