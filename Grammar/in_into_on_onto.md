> `To` really introduces that destination.

## inside

- The cat is **inside** the box.

There is no difference with `in`.

- The milk is in the fridge.
- The milk is inside the fridge.

`inside` and `in` both show the location.

But, `inside` is used to emphasize completely covered. like a box, container, etc.
`inside` is more precise.

## exception

### in

- Come in. (there is no object)

We always use `in` with a city or country.

- This picture was token in Spain.

### into

We can talk about a **transformation** with `into`.

- A caterpillar turns into a butterfly.
- I had to translate all of these documents into English.

But there is a exception: 

We can also use `into` to speak about an **impact**.

- A bird just flew into the window.
- Cars are driven into walls to test their safety.

### on

- He walked on without his microphone.(onto the stage)

we don't need to repeat `onto the stage`, bacause it's already clear in the conversation or in the text.

### onto

- He walked onto the stage without his microphone.

### special verbs

- dive
- drop
- fall
- jump
- put
- throw

With these verbs you can use in/into or on/onto interchangeably.

- Put the ice cream in the freezer.
- Put the ice cream into the freezer.
- He threw the pizza on the roof.
- He threw the pizza onto the roof.
<br/>

- Look in my eyes and tell me the truth.
- Look into my eyes and tell me the truth.

It's very common to interchange `look in` with `look into` for native speaker.

## in to & on to

In spoken English, It doesn't matter. They sounds the same.

This is all about written English.

- We all chipped in to buy Frankie a present.
- Try this dress on to see if it fits you.

`chip in` and `try on` are both phrasal verbs.

`to buy` and `to see` are both infinitives.

> **infinitive: to + base verb**
> In these examples, the infinitive is showing us why we do the action.

- I <ins>went out</ins> <ins>to celebrate</ins> my birthday.

> To: part of the infinitive
> To: a preposition

- The student <ins>handed</ins> his essay <ins>in</ins> <ins>to</ins> the teacher.
- Take a booklet and <ins>pass</ins> the stack <ins>on</ins> <ins>to</ins> the person sitting next to you.
- The mayor decided not to <ins>give in</ins> <ins>to</ins> the protesters' demands.

Some phrasal verbs already have `into` and `onto` as their preposition.
