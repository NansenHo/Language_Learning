# Preposition - IN,ON,AT,BY

## IN

### clear edges

IN: **being within something**. inside the edges of something.

e.g.

- I got my key in my pocket.
- There's some milk in the fridge.
- She left it in the top drawer. 她把它放在了最上面的抽屉
- There's nothing left in my cup. 我的杯子里什么也没有了

> The edges of my cup(the lake / drawer / fridge / pocket) are very clear, we can see inside them.

### building / rooms / places

We can use "in" with buildings, rooms and places that can surround a person or an object.

e.g.

- Can you take a seat in the waiting room please?
- I've left my bag in your office.
- Why don't we have a picnic in the park? 为什么我们不在公园野餐呢

### the edges are less clear

But there are lots of times when you need to use "in" when the edges are less clear.

For example, with areas or regions or cities and towns.

e.g.

- I'm filming this video in Spain.

- Regolisa is a small village in the mountains. Regolisa 是一个位于山区的小村庄。
- We are going for a drive in the country. 我们打算去乡下兜风。

All of these nouns have borders and edges, even if they're not really obvious or clear.

We can physically be located inside the edges of this space.

### groups of people

When talking about groups of people, you can often use "in".

e.g.

- She works in the finance team. (surround by people)
- He got selected to play in the national team.

#### exception

There's an exception for important high-level groups where members are often elected. (在重要的高层团体中存在一个例外，这些团体的成员通常是经过选举产生的。)

e.g.

- He's on the board. 他是董事会成员
- They're on the committee（委员会） / on the council（委员会，理事会，地方议会）.

### liquids and other substances

We can also use "in" with liquids and other substances to show what they contain. (我们也可以在液体和其他物质中使用“in”这个介词来表示它们包含了什么成分。)

e.g.

- Careful! There're a lot of chilli in that sauce. (那个酱料里有很多辣椒)
- There're too much sugar in soft drink.
- Do you have milk in your coffee. (你的咖啡里加了牛奶吗)

> IN is **three-dimensional** preposition.
>

## ON

### on flat surfaces

> **on surfaces**, or things that can be thought-of as surfaces, like walls or tables. (指在什么的表面)
>
