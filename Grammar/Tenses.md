## Grammatical Structure

### All Simple Tenses

We use simple tenses for 

- habits
- repeated actions
- things that are always true like facts
- describe states
- single action, one action（No repeated actions, no states.）

A state is a **situation** or an **opinion** or a **feeling**.
States don't change often.

#### Present Simple

- I **wake up** at 6 a.m. every morning.
- I **do not wake up** at 6 a.m. every morning.
- **Do** you **wake up**at 6 a.m. every morning?
- Doug is our team leader.
- I enjoy pop music.
- I made an omelette for breakfast.

##### Special present simple

Present simple can be used for a scheduled future event.

But it's something that's scheduled, it's not something that we can control.

- My bus leaves in 10 minutes.
- Our train leaves at 9.
- The movie starts in 30 minutes.
- My classes start next week.

#### Past Simple

Present simple is already clear mean now.

But, in the context of conversation or text,
we need **a specific time** with the past simple.
we need a bit more detail.

- **When I was in high school**, I **woke up** at 6 a.m. every morning.
- I **did not wake up** at 6 a.m. every morning.
- **Did** you **wake up** at 6 a.m. every morning?
- Student did their homework online. (this would mean **now they don't**.)
- Student did their homework online **during the pandemic**, but now they don't need to.
- I had long hair **until I turned 18**. (past state and a specific time)
- **Last year**, Doug was our team leader.
- **When I was a kid**, I never eta the crust on the toast. I hated it.
- **When I was a little kid**, I had a very cute yorkie.
- I bought a new phone yesterday.

#### Future Simple

In the future simple, we also need a specific time.
we need a bit more detail.

Because we always know what's going to happen in the future, that future simple is often used for predictions and promises.

- Starting the 15th of January, I **will wake up** at 6 a.m. every morning.
- I **will not wake up** at 6 a.m. every morning.
- **Will** you **wake up** at 6 a.m. every morning?
- Student will do their homework **beginning May**.
- **In a few years**, I will have long hair. (that will be my future state)
- **Next Week**, Doug will be our new team leader.
- **Next Year**, I will floss more.
- What will earth be like in one thousand years.
- The chef will prepare something nice for us.

### All Continuous Tenses

Continuous tenses express a **temporary** action or situation. They are not permanent or repeated actions like the simple tenses.

The continuous tenses can't be the main action, but many times they are the **background action**.
We usually see this with the past continuous and the future continuous.


#### Present Continuous

- I am talking to you.
- It's getting dark. (It doesn't get dark forever.)
- I was holding a cup of coffee on the couch when my son bumped into me.

#### Past Continuous

we need a specific time.

- I was talking to you yesterday.
- What were you doing at 3 pm yesterday?
- Don't message me after 6. I **will be having dinner**(background action) with my boss.
- I know Keira will be loving the party.

#### Future Continuous

we need a specific time.

- I will be talking to you in 1 hour.
- What will you be doing 3 hours from now?

## Stative verb & Dynamic verb

stative verb describe a state rather than an action.

1. feelings
