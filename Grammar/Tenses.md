## Grammatical Structure

### Simple Tenses

We use simple tenses for 

- habits
- repeated actions
- things that are always true like facts
- describe states

A state is a **situation** or an **opinion** or a **feeling**.
States don't change often.

#### Present Simple

- I **wake up** at 6 a.m. every morning.
- I **do not wake up** at 6 a.m. every morning.
- **Do** you **wake up**at 6 a.m. every morning?
- Doug is our team leader.

#### Past Simple

Present simple is already clear mean now.

But, in the context of conversation or text,
we need **a specific time** with the past simple.
we need a bit more detail.

- **When I was in high school**, I **woke up** at 6 a.m. every morning.
- I **did not wake up** at 6 a.m. every morning.
- **Did** you **wake up** at 6 a.m. every morning?
- Student did their homework online. (this would mean **now they don't**.)
- Student did their homework online **during the pandemic**, but now they don't need to.
- I had long hair **until I turned 18**. (past state and a specific time)
- **Last year**, Doug was our team leader.
- **When I was a kid**, I never eta the crust on the toast. I hated it.

#### Future Simple

In the future simple, we also need a specific time.
we need a bit more detail.

- Starting the 15th of January, I **will wake up** at 6 a.m. every morning.

- **Will** you **wake up** at 6 a.m. every morning?
